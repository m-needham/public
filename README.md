# Bus Directions from STJ to UV1700

There are two main ways to take the bus home from STJ. The first involves less walking, but the bus only runs once an hour. The second runs much more frequently, but requires you to walk from St. Joseph to the CSU transit center on main campus, which is about a 20 minute walk down meldrum. 

## 1. Taking the #10 bus.

The #10 runs once an hour and passes the nearest stop to STJ at X:46 every hour, with the last bus at 6:46pm each weekday. See the schedule below.

All you need to do is walk from the west parking lot of STJ on Meldrum, turn right, and cross Laporte to reach the covered bus stop. Alternatively, you could walk a few extra minutes to the downtown transit center - this would let you get to the bus a few minutes before it departs.

Once on the #10 bus, take it for about 10 minutes while it travels west on Laporte to Taft Hill and then loops around to Mulberry. Your stop is "Mulberry & Cook," as shown in the picture below. Just watch the display near the driver until you see it!

From there, it's a quick walk back to UV1700 through the neighborhood.

## 2. Taking the #3, #31, or #32 from the CSU Transit Center

If it's nice out and you would enjoy the walk, you could walk from St. Joesph to the CSU Transit Center and take any of the buses listed above to UV1700. These run much more frequently than the #10. The walk is about 20 minutes down meldrum.
